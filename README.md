Try to stick to the To-Do, open an issue if you have an idea for a new feature. If you've added something cool, email `s@jajoosam.tech` to notify me, and we'll try to merge :smile:



## Disclaimer

All libert does is fetch books from gen.lib.rus.ec, with a different UI. It is designed to make using the source easier, and does not host anything itself. I, Samarth Jajoo, claim no responsibility for any materials hosted at the source.
